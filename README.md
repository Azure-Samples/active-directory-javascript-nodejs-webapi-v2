# Protect a Node.js web API with Microsoft identity platform

There's a newer version of this sample taking advantage of [passport-azure-ad](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/maintenance/passport-azure-ad).

Check it out: [JavaScript single-page application calling a protected Node.js web API](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-javascript-tutorial/tree/main/3-Authorization-II/1-call-api);

If you really need to access this sample, you can navigate to the [master branch](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-javascript-nodejs-webapi-v2/tree/master), but please know that it's no longer maintained.
